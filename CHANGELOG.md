## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Mount symlink creation for session directories
  - Automatically creates symlinks from `/sessions/<session>/mnt/<folder>` to actual host paths
  - Parses `additionalMounts` parameter from Claude Desktop to determine mount mappings
  - Creates `uploads` directory for file uploads within sessions
  - Comprehensive debug logging for mount creation process
- `createMountSymlinks()` function for session mount point management
- `extractSessionName()` function for parsing session names from spawn arguments
- VM path translation for `/sessions/` paths to host filesystem paths
- `vm.readFile()` method for reading files from VM filesystem with base64 encoding
- `vm.writeFile()` method for writing files to VM filesystem with base64 encoding
- `vm.isDebugLoggingEnabled()` method to check debug flag status
- `vm.stopVM()` method for clean shutdown of VM processes
- Path translation in `desktop.openFile()`, `desktop.revealFile()`, and `desktop.previewFile()`
- Path translation in `vm.spawn()` for shared working directory paths
- Path translation in process stdin data

### Fixed
- "Path not found" error when starting Cowork sessions
  - Sessions failed because mount points at `/sessions/<session>/mnt/<folder>` didn't exist
  - Now properly creates symlinks to user's actual directories before spawning Claude binary

### Known Limitations
- Folder selection dropdown doesn't update immediately after selecting a new folder
  - Folder is stored correctly and sessions work as expected
  - **Workaround**: Press `Ctrl+R` to refresh after selecting a folder

### Security
- Path traversal protection in file read/write operations
- Secure directory creation with 0o700 permissions
- Secure file creation with 0o600 permissions
